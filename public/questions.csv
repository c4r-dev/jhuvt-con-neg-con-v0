Neuroserpin,Does neuroserpin induce axonal elongation during neuronal development?,Neuroserpin protein exposure,Axon length of neurons,Sterilization protocol,Y,"Sterlizing the neuroserpin matches the pre-sterilized medium, but could the sterilization protocol itself affect axon growth?",ABSENT,Absent
,,,,Protein suspension vehicle,Y,"Is the neuroserpin protein suspended in water, or a buffer of some kind? Could this make a difference?",ABSENT,Absent
,,,,Protein purification protocol,Y,Could any sort of contaminant or processing artifact from the protein purification process be responsible for axon growth?,ABSENT,Absent
,,,,Protein addition protocol,Y,"When the cells are treated with neuroserpin, are they exposed to circulating air or shaking of the plates? Could this make a difference?",ABSENT,Absent
,,,,Presence of a protein,Y,"Neuroserpin has a specific functional role, but it is also a protein. Could the neurons detect or metabolize this added protein in a way that alters growth but is unrelated to the identity of the specific protein?",ABSENT,Absent
,,,,Neuroserpin functionality,Y,"Neuroserpin has a specific functional role as a serine protease inhibitor. This is the one thing we really want to test, our true independent variable.",ABSENT,Absent
